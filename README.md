# Natural_Language_Processing_Projects

This repository contains projects based on Natural Language Processing (NLP). <br>

(I) Basic Introduction to NLP:

-> NLP is a subset of Artificial Intelligence, where we deal with the text data. <br>
-> They are capable of processing and extract meaningful insights from huge unstructured data. <br>
-> There are numerous use-cases in NLP such as Topic Modelling, Text Summarisation, Chatbots, Sentiment Analysis etc. <br>

(II) Standard NLP workflow: <br>

(1) Collect text data <br>
(2) Text Pre-Processing <br>
(3) Text parsing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <br>
(4) Text representation and feature engineering <br>
(5) Modelling <br>
(6) Evaluation and Deployment <br>

(III) NLP pipeline step-by-step: <br>
